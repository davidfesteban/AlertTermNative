# AlertTermNative

AlertTermNative is a Java-based command-line tool for terminal notifications and alerts. The project provides an intuitive way to manage and display system alerts through a native terminal interface.

# Code Improvement Suggestions

## Autogenerate Classes from OpenAPI Spec
- **Suggestion:** The classes `ApiClient`, `Alert`, `Content`, and `QueryTerm` should be autogenerated from the Swagger/OpenAPI specification.
- **Rationale:** Autogenerating these from the API specification ensures consistency between the client and the API, reduces human error, and simplifies maintenance as changes in the API can be reflected in the code automatically.

## Domain Layer Mapping
- **Note:** In this example, no mapping to a domain layer is performed for simplicity.
- **Improvement:** While this is fine for a small project, for more complex systems, using a domain-driven design (DDD) approach is recommended to encapsulate business logic more effectively.

## UUID for Consistent ID Representation
- **Suggestion:** Refactor the `id` fields into UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers).
- **Rationale:** Ensuring a consistent ID format across the application promotes uniformity and reduces ambiguity. UUIDs are well-suited for distributed systems where uniqueness is critical.

## Language Processing with AI
- **Suggestion:** Integrate AI-based natural language processing to handle the contextual and language-matching issues.
- **Rationale:** Using AI can improve the ability to understand different contexts, especially in multi-language environments, ensuring more accurate and meaningful results.

## Typing Refactor: Enums and Timestamps
- **Suggestion:** Refactor the following:
    - `Language` and `Type` fields should be implemented as enums for better type safety and clarity.
    - `Date` fields should use real timestamps or a proper `Date` type instead of a string.
- **Rationale:** Enums provide a finite set of possible values, making the code more robust and reducing errors. Dates should be handled with appropriate date-time types to avoid parsing issues and provide clearer semantics.

## Unique Alerts Handling
- **Assumption:** The system assumes that all alerts are unique and does not perform any duplicate checking.
- **Rationale:** If duplicates might be a concern in the future, consider adding logic to enforce uniqueness.

## Immutability with Records
- **Note:** The `Alert` class uses Java Records for immutability.
- **Rationale:** Records make the class simple, concise, and immutable, which can help prevent unintended side effects.

## Validators and Exception Handling
- **Comment:** Advanced validators and robust exception handling are skipped in this example for simplicity.
- **Improvement:** In a production setting, consider integrating more thorough validation and error handling mechanisms to ensure data integrity and resilience.

## Example Alert Record Definition
The following example illustrates the `Alert` record definition with basic validation.

## TODOs

	•	Error handling improvements: Add better error messages for edge cases such as unsupported terminal types.
	•	Cross-platform support: Ensure the tool works seamlessly across different terminal emulators.
	•	Performance optimization: Refactor the alert notification process to minimize memory usage.
	•	Customizable themes: Allow users to customize alert themes and styles.
	•	Unit Tests: Implement comprehensive unit tests for core modules.

## Other Refactor Suggestions

	•	Main Class Refactor: Consider splitting the main class into smaller classes for better modularity. For example, creating a separate AlertManager class to handle alert logic.
	•	Dependency Injection: Implement dependency injection to reduce coupling between modules, improving testability and maintainability.
	•	Logging Framework: Integrate a proper logging framework (e.g., SLF4J) to replace System.out.println for better control over log levels and output.
	•	Configuration Files: Move configuration settings to an external config.yml or properties file to make the tool more flexible.
